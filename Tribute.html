      <p>
        Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) was a German politician, demagogue, and leader of the Nazi Party. He rose to power in the early 1930s and became both Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and Führer (leader) in 1934. His policies of territorial expansion and racial purity led to the outbreak of World War II, and he orchestrated the genocide known as the Holocaust.

      <p>
        Hitler's vision of a "Greater Germany" led to the annexation of territories across Europe and sparked a conflict that would engulf much of the world. Under his leadership, millions of people, including six million Jews, were persecuted and systematically exterminated during the Holocaust.

        Despite his defeat and death in 1945, Hitler's legacy as one of history's most infamous dictators continues to have a profound impact on global history and politics.
